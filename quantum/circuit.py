class Circuit:
    r"""Class for creating a quantum circuit.

    Warning:
        The current version only supports gates in [I, H, X, Y, Z, S, T, Rx, Ry, Rz, U, U3,
        CH, CX / CNOT, CY, CZ, CRx, CRy, CRz, CU, CU3, SWAP].

    Hint:
        Quantum noise can also be applied to a quantum circuit, including:

        1. Bit flip noise
        2. Phase flip noise
        3. Bit-phase flip noise
        4. Amplitude damping noise
        5. Phase damping noise
        6. Depolarizing noise

        Noisy circuit simulation can only be implemented by QNET ``DensityMatrix`` backend.

    Important:
        We support dynamic quantum circuit. That is, we can perform measurement in the middle of the
        computation and reset the qubit. We can also perform classically conditioned operations. For example,
        a circuit for quantum teleportation can be constructed as:

        >>> cir = Circuit()
        >>> cir.rx(0, 0.1)
        >>> cir.h(1)
        >>> cir.cnot([1, 2])
        >>> cir.cnot([0, 1])
        >>> cir.h(0)
        >>> cir.measure(0, mid='a')
        >>> cir.measure(1, mid='b')
        >>> cir.z(2, condition='a')
        >>> cir.x(2, condition='b')
        >>> cir.measure(2, mid='c')
        >>> cir.output_ids = ['a', 'b', 'c']
        >>> results = cir.run(shots=1024, backend=Backend.StateVector)
        >>> print(results)

    Attributes:
        name (str): name of the circuit
        agenda (list): agenda of the circuit
        output_ids (list): measurement IDs that will be used to obtain the sampling result

    Note:
         In a dynamic quantum circuit, a quantum system will be measured multiple times. Some measurements are used
         to steer the computation while others are used to obtain the final results.
         The attribute ``output_ids`` indicates which measurements will be used as the final results.
         If ``output_ids`` is not specified, the last measurement on each qubit will be used.

            there are two different methods to identify which one to choose:

            1. Deterministic selection: always select the first one encountered ("deterministic")
            2. Random selection: randomly select one from all local optima ("random")

            If no method is specified, then by default the random greedy algorithm will be executed once.

            If 'shots' is set to a value greater than one, the random greedy algorithm will be run multiple
            times. It will return the dynamic circuit with the minimal circuit width across all runs.

            Multiple runs of the deterministic greedy algorithm produce consistent result.

        Note:

            8. hybrid algorithm ("hybrid")
            9. brute-force searching ("brute_force")

            Please see the reference [Dynamic quantum circuit compilation arXiv:2310.11021] for technical details.

            Users have the option to specify a set of qubits that can not be reused during compilation.
            By default, all unmeasured qubits are set to non-reusable.

            Here is an example of dynamic circuit compilation:

            >>> from quantum.circuit import Circuit
            >>> cir = Circuit()
            >>> cir.h(0)
            >>> cir.h(1)
            >>> cir.h(2)
            >>> cir.h(3)
            >>> cir.rx(0, 0.1)
            >>> cir.ry(1, 0.2)
            >>> cir.rz(2, 0.3)
            >>> cir.u(3, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3)
            >>> cir.cnot([0, 1])
            >>> cir.cz([1, 2])
            >>> cir.cnot([2, 3])
            >>> cir.measure(0, mid='a')
            >>> cir.measure(1, mid='b')
            >>> cir.measure(2, mid='c')
            >>> cir.measure(3, mid='d')
            >>> cir.output_ids = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
            >>> cir.print_circuit()
            >>> cir.reduce(method="minimum_remaining_values")
            >>> cir.print_circuit()

        Warning:
            For a dynamic circuit as input, it is recommended to start by calling the 'to_static' method to convert
            the dynamic circuit into a static circuit. Following this, the 'reduce' method can be used to explore
            whether the original dynamic circuit width can be further reduced.
